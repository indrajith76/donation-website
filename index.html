          <p>
            Street children are constantly being misled and everyone needs help
            to guide them in the right way. So that they too can live in a
            beautiful way in the society. And through their food, education and
            proper counseling, their quality of life can be improved and they
            can be saved from going astray.

          <p>
            Chasing street children involved in various bad deeds and drug
            addiction can be dangerous for the country and the nation. So if we
            can educate them through their education and proper counseling, they
            will bring benefits to the nation and the country.
